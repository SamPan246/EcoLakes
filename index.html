        <h1>Plastic Pollution has affected many parts of the world. In local communities, many lakes and ponds are drastically affected by this waste, as microplastics reduce oxygen levels in the water, resulting in a majority of aquatic life being killed. Moreover, certain plastics fuel algae blooms, which can overtake an ecosystem and kill fish or other plants. Clearly, the effects of this problem are devastating for many small bodies of water.</h1>

              <h1>A solution to tackling this problem would be to implement more water fountains in lakes. These fountains will aerate oxygen back into the lake which microplastics may have taken away. Moreover, this resolution can also prevent algae blooms, as the aeration created by the fountains breaks up algae spores on the surface of the water and transports them to the bottom of the lakes. Because little sunlight is able to penetrate to the bottom of these bodies of water, harmful algae blooms are unable to grow. Therefore, this solution would counter the effects of plastic pollution, and help sustain aquatic life in lakes and ponds.</h1>
